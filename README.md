# 3d-gaussian-splatting-satellite-images
## Overview 
This project explores the application of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for reconstructing 3D structures from sparse satellite imagery. Using the DFC2019 Track 3 dataset, we aim to generate accurate 3D reconstructions from limited multi-view satellite images (10-20 views per scene) with varying lighting and quality conditions.
## Dataset 
We use Track 3 of the 2019 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest (DFC2019), which includes:
- 110 scenes with approximately 20 multi-angle satellite images per scene
- RGB images
- RPC camera metadata
- Digital Surface Models (DSMs) as ground truth heightmaps
